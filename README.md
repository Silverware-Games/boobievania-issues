# boobievania-issues
Issue/Idea tracker for the world's first Boobievania, a pixel 2d Retro Platforming game where as you unlock new items and backtrack to discover new paths your boobies grow. Designed to be "Marketable"
Probably going to use the SWGIO backend. 
Not sure if it will be truly an 18+ game or just hinting at NSFW.
